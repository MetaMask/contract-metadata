## Submission Process

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your logo image in a web-safe format to the `images` folder.
3. Add an entry to the `contract-map.json` file with the specified address as the key, and the image file's name as the value.
Criteria:

- The icon should be small, square, but high resolution, ideally a vector/svg.
- Do not add your entry to the end of the JSON map, messing with the trailing comma. Your pull request should only be an - - -- addition of lines, and any line removals should be deliberate deprecations of those logos.
- PR should include link to official project website referencing the suggested address.
- Project website should include explanation of project.
- Project should have clear signs of activity, either traffic on the network, activity on GitHub, or community buzz.
- Nice to have a verified source code on a block explorer like Etherscan.
- Must have a 'NEUTRAL' reputation or 'OK' reputation on Etherscan.
